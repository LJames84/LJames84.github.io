         <p>I am a pretty good student as I am in college classes right now. I was born and raised in Kettering, Ohio. I
            do a lot of sports including basketball, football, baseball, bowling, and running. I really love listening
            to music.</p>

         <p>In my free time, I like to hang out with my friends and my girlfriend. I collect all types of athletic
            trading cards. I still do it to this day but I mainly collect Pokemon cards now and my collection has gotten
            pretty big as I've gotten older.</p>

         <p>Most nights I stay up until 11 or 12, but I try to fix my sleep schedule. I usually wake up at about 10 or
            11 during the summer, but during school, I wake up at about 7:50. I sometimes wake up at 4:45 in the morning
            if I have morning practice for cross country. I'm currently running right now.</p>
